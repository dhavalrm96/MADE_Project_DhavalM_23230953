## Project Title
Taxi & Weather Insights: Understanding Taxi Demand Trends and Weather Impact

## Main Question
What are the key weather and time-based factors that influence taxi demand patterns and trends?

## Description
This project aims to analyze the impact of various weather conditions (such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, and visibility) and temporal factors on taxi demand in New York City. By combining weather data with taxi demand metrics (total passenger count and trip count), this study seeks to uncover patterns that could aid taxi operators, city planners, and meteorologists in understanding how external factors drive taxi usage. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights that optimize fleet management, improve public transportation strategies, and enhance city mobility during varying weather conditions.
