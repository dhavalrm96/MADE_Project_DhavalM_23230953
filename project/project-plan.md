## Title
Heart Attack Risk Prediction and Analysis Using Patient Health Data

## Main Question
What are the key health and lifestyle factors that contribute to the risk of heart attacks?

## Description
This study aims to develop a predictive model to assess the risk of heart attacks using comprehensive patient health data. By analyzing various factors such as age, BMI, chronic conditions, lifestyle choices, and medical history, the project seeks to identify which variables most significantly contribute to heart attack risk. Understanding these relationships is crucial for preventive healthcare, personalized patient interventions, and public health strategies. The ultimate goal is to provide insights that can help healthcare providers take preemptive measures to reduce heart attack incidences.
