## Project Title
CardioCare: Predictive Modeling for Cardiovascular Disease Risk

## Main Question
What are the key health and lifestyle factors that contribute to the risk of cardiovascular disease?

## Description
This project aims to develop a predictive model to assess the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) using comprehensive patient health data. By analyzing various factors such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, and other health indicators, the study seeks to identify which variables most significantly contribute to cardiovascular disease risk. Understanding these relationships is crucial for preventive healthcare, personalized patient interventions, and public health strategies. The ultimate goal is to provide insights that help healthcare providers implement early interventions to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease.
