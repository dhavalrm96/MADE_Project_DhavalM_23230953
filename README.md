## Project Overview: Taxi & Weather Insights

This project examines the relationship between weather conditions and taxi demand in New York City. It integrates data from two open datasets to explore how factors like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility affect taxi usage patterns.

### Features:
- Combines taxi data from Kaggle with weather data from Visual Crossing.
- Builds an automated data pipeline to clean, transform, and integrate datasets.
- Provides insights into weekday vs. weekend trends, seasonal patterns, and the impact of weather on taxi demand.
